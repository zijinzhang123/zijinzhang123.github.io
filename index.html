  I am an Assistant Professor of Business Analytics at the <a href="https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/carroll-school.html">Carroll School of Management</a>, Boston College. I received my Ph.D. in Technology & Operations from the Stephen M. Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan, and a B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics from Nanjing University.

    My research focuses on data-driven decision making in operations management.
    Specifically, I study how data can be strategically managed and applied to improve operational decisions, centered around three core dimensions of data value:
  </p>
  
  <ol style="list-style: none; padding-left: 1.5em; margin-top: 0em; margin-bottom: 0.35em;">
     <li> (1) <b>engineering value</b>: how to design data-driven algorithms that support real-time and large-scale decision making under uncertainty; </li>
     <li> (2) <b>economic value</b>: how to balance the cost of data acquisition with its decision impact via smart data selection and active learning; </li>
     <li> (3) <b>social value</b>: how data practices impact society, fairness, and well-being, particularly related to data ethics and technology regulation. </li>
  </ol>
  These problems are studied through real-world applications, including offline data use in retail decisions, data limitations in emerging AI markets, and resource disparities in public-sector operations.
  Methodologically, I employ tools from optimization, probability, game theory, and machine learning.
