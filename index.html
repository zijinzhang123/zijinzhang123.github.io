  <br />
  Welcome! I am Zijin (pronounced ZEE-jin). I received my Ph.D. in Technology & Operations from the Stephen M. Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan, where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor <a href="https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/hyun-soo-ahn">Hyun-Soo Ahn</a> and Professor <a href="https://baardman.github.io/">Lennart Baardman</a>. 
  Prior to that, I earned a B.S. degree in Mathematics and Statistics from Nanjing University and studied as an exchange student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

  <br />

  <br />

  <b>I will be joining the Carroll School of Management at Boston College as an Assistant Professor of Business Analytics in Fall 2025. </b>
  
  <br />
  <br />

  
  <p>
  My research explores the engineering, economic, and social value of data through the lens of operational decision-making, with applications in retail analytics, nonprofit operations, and emerging AI markets.
  I focus on three core questions:
  </p>
  <ol style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0;">
    <li>(1) How data quality and bias shape decisions — learning with biased information;</li>
    <li>(2) What level of data precision or scale is “good enough” — guided by data design and active learning;</li>
    <li>(3) Where, how, and from whom data should be acquired — raising issues of data ethics and regulation.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>
    Methodologically, I employ tools such as mathematical modeling, dynamic programming, stochastic optimization, and probability analysis.
  </p>

  <!-- My research focuses on operational efficiency and strategic decision-making across various sectors including retail management, supply chain management, and non-profit operations. I am particularly interested in understanding how data can enhance algorithmic decision-making and provide valuable insights for policy design. Through my work, I aim to develop innovative solutions and theoretical insights that address complex challenges and improve overall service performance. -->

  Below are my talks at the 2024 INFORMS Annual Meeting:

  
  <ul>
    <li> I will be presenting our paper "More Data or Better Data? Impact of Costly Data Collection on the Newsvendor Problem" in “Data Collection and Analytics” session at <b> Summit 441, 2:30 PM - 3:00 PM on Tuesday, October 22</b>. </li>
    <li> I will be speaking at the Minority Issues Forum at Summit 448, 2:15 PM - 3:30 PM on Monday, October 21. </li>
  </ul>
