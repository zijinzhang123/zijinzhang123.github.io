  Hello! I am Zijin (pronounced ZEE-jin). I received my Ph.D. in Technology & Operations from the Stephen M. Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan, where I was advised by Professor <a href="https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/hyun-soo-ahn">Hyun-Soo Ahn</a> and Professor <a href="https://baardman.github.io/">Lennart Baardman</a>. 
  Prior to that, I earned a B.S. degree in Mathematics and Statistics from Nanjing University and studied as an exchange student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
  
  <br />
  <b> I will be joining the Carroll School of Management at Boston College as an Assistant Professor of Business Analytics in Fall 2025. </b>
  <br />

  
  <p>
    My research focuses on data-driven decision-making in operations management.
    Specifically, I study how data can be strategically managed and applied to improve operational decisions, centered around three core dimensions of data value:
    <ol style="list-style: none; padding-left: 1.5em; margin-top: 0em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">
     <li> (1) <b>engineering value</b>: how to design data-driven algorithms that support real-time and large-scale decision making under uncertainty; </li>
     <li> (2) <b>economic value</b>: how to balance the cost of data acquisition with its decision impact via smart data selection and active learning; </li>
     <li> (3) <b>social value</b>: how data practices impact society, fairness, and well-being, particularly related to data ethics and technology regulation. </li>
    </ol>
    These problems are studied through real-world applications, including offline data use in retail decisions, data limitations in emerging AI markets, and resource disparities in public-sector operations.
    Methodologically, I employ tools from optimization, probability, game theory, and machine learning.
