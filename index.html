  I received a PhD in Technology & Operations from the Stephen M. Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan, where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor <a href="https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/hyun-soo-ahn">Hyun-Soo Ahn</a> and Professor <a href="https://baardman.github.io/">Lennart Baardman</a>. 
  Prior to that, I earned a bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Statistics from Nanjing University and studied as an exchange student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2017.

  <br />

  <br />

  <b>I will be joining the Carroll School of Management at Boston College as an Assistant Professor of Business Analytics in Fall 2025. </b>
  
  <br />
  
  <br />
  My research goal is to improve data-driven decisions in imperfect environments where operational misalignments exist or obtaining perfect data is impossible. 
  By developing models grounded in practice, my research provides algorithmic solutions and novel insights for retail analytics, inventory management, and emerging societal challenges. 
  Methodologically, I employ tools such as mathematical modeling, dynamic programming, stochastic optimization, and probability analysis.


  <!-- My research focuses on operational efficiency and strategic decision-making across various sectors including retail management, supply chain management, and non-profit operations. I am particularly interested in understanding how data can enhance algorithmic decision-making and provide valuable insights for policy design. Through my work, I aim to develop innovative solutions and theoretical insights that address complex challenges and improve overall service performance. -->

    <li> I will be speaking at the Minority Issues Forum at Summit 448, 2:15 PM - 3:30 PM on Monday, October 21. </li>
